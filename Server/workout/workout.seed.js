            difficulty: 5,
            description: `Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.
            Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles ("bracing"), your glute and quadriceps muscles and align your head with your spine. Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).
            Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat/floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.
            Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. For extra strength think about pushing the floor away from you. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.
            An alternative position is to turn your hands to face forwards and keep your your elbows close to your sides during the downward phase. This shifts the emphasis from the chest muscles onto the triceps and may reduce stresses in the shoulder joint. 
            Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.`,

Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase, contract your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to create stability for your core. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.
                Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. As your press upwards, extend your left hip to lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee extended. Attempt to avoid rotation in your hip as you raise the left leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows and your left leg is extended off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat with your opposite leg

                difficulty: 1,
                description: `Starting Position: Lie on your right side on an exercise mat with your left leg lying directly over your right leg and bend your knees to a comfortable position. Raise your upper body to support yourself on your right arm, your right elbow should bend to 90 degrees and be positioned directly under your shoulder. Align your head with your spine and keep your hips and lower knee in contact with the exercise mat.
                Upward Phase: Exhale, gently contract your abdominal / core muscles to stiffen your spine and lift your hips off the mat, but keeping contact with your knee, and head aligned with your spine.
                Lowering Phase: Inhale and gently return yourself to your starting position.
                Exercise Variation: You can increase the exercise intensity by increasing the length of time you are in the raised position.`,

Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n" +
                    "From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.\n" +
                    "After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\n" +

                title: 'The Shoulder Press',
                difficulty: 9,
                description: `While holding a dumbbell in each hand, sit on a military press bench or utility bench that has back support. Place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
Now raise the dumbbells to shoulder height one at a time using your thighs to help propel them up into position.
Make sure to rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.
Now, exhale and push the dumbbells upward until they touch at the top.
Then, after a brief pause at the top contracted position, slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
Variations: You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.

You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.`,

Keep your chin parallel to floor with a natural arch in your back.Brace your core and slowly lower your hips toward the floor until your knees form a 90-degree angle. Quickly drive your hips upward, fully extending your knees and rising up on the balls of your feet, swinging the ball close to your body until it comes directly under your chin and elbows to form a 90-degree angle. Quickly drop your hips back into a deep squat position until the back of your legs become parallel to the floor. Pause at bottom.`,
