            The Tel Aviv Samsung Marathon offers various courses, giving all runners a chance to participate, including a full 42.2-kilometer marathon, a 21.1-kilometer half marathon, 10-kilometer, five-kilometer and a kids’ mini marathon. It will also host a 42 kilometer hand cycle cycle for athletes with special needs.
            The course goes down the Tel Aviv and Jaffa seashore, as well as the main streets of Tel Aviv.
            The marathon is one of Tel Aviv’s main projects to attract an international crowd, and this year it is estimated that 40,000 people will be running.
            The week before the marathon, an exposition is held at Kikar Rabin, where runners pick up their T-shirt and racing kit. There is a ton of exciting running gadgets and accessories to get runners pumped up for the big event. They even photograph participants, making them feel like a real superstar.
            This race is probably the gimmickiest of all, with a pasta party the night before, as well as the option to pay an extra 120 shekels to hang out in the marathon VIP longue. But with all things said, it makes for a fun race.
            They have recently added the option of ’running for a cause’ in which runners can choose an organization to donate to by getting sponsors.
